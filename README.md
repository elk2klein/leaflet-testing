## Getting your map online using GitHub
1. Create a GitHub account.
2. Follow the steps at https://github.com/HandsOnDataViz/leaflet-map-csv. Use your username as the name of your repository, and make sure it is public.
3. Follow steps #1-5 under ["Publish Your Website Using GitHub Pages"](https://hackernoon.com/use-custom-domain-with-github-pages-2-straightforward-steps-cf561eee244f) to get your website (and map) online. Your page may take several minutes to appear.
4. Replace data.csv with your data: 
    - Click on the data.csv file in GitHub. 
    - Open the csv with your data in Excel. 
    - Make sure the column names in your csv match the ones in the GitHub file. 
    - Save your local csv as "data.csv"
    - Click and drag your local data.csv file into the GitHub repository to upload the file (or use the "add files" menu). 
    - Document what changes you made and press "commit" (directly to the main branch). 
    - The data.csv in GitHub will be replaced by your file. It will take a few minutes for your map to update with the new data.
5. Make sure your column headers match the variables "called" in index.html.
6. Make any other edits you'd like to index.html. For example things like variable names, popups, markers, adding images and page titles, other customization options available on [the Leaflet website](https://leafletjs.com/) [(the Leaflet website as of March 31, 2022)](https://leafletjs.com/SlavaUkraini/).
